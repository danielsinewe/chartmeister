## Security Considerations

### Schema Validation

The Chartmeister library primarily deals with JSON schema validation. Security considerations include:

- **JSON Schema Injection**: Malicious schema properties
- **File Size Limits**: Large files causing DoS
- **Validation Bypass**: Incorrect schema validation

### Best Practices

When using the Chartmeister library:

1. **Validate input**: Always validate JSON before processing
2. **Size limits**: Implement reasonable file size limits
3. **Sanitization**: Sanitize user input in chart data
4. **Updates**: Keep the library updated to latest version

### Dependencies

We regularly audit our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **ajv-cli**: JSON schema validation
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
